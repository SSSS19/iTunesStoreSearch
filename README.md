# iTunesStoreSearch

This app was created with the help of the great folks at RayWenderlich.com and the book iOS Apprentice.

In this app, the goal was to learn how to perform HTTP GET requests to a web service and then how to parse the JSON data provided from the request along with downloading files such as images. The store to be searched was the iTunes store in which a user could search music, software, e-books and other options to be displayed in a table view. A pop-up view was created so that when a user clicks a table cell, more information can be displayed. Finally, the app would display itself differently in landscape orientations, in portrait view, the table view was utilised, however, in landscape collections views were used to make the app more user-friendly. This app was done alongside learning Git and version control.
